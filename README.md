# Rock-paper-scissor
Rock Paper Scissor

This is a simple rock-paper-scissor game with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented in Python using the tkinter library.

Getting started
To run the program, you need to have Python and the Pillow and tkinter libraries installed on your machine.

You can install these libraries by running the following command: pip install Pillow tkinter
Once you have the necessary libraries installed, you can run the game by running the main.py file: python main.py
This will start the game and open the GUI window.

How to play
The game is very simple: the player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer chooses a random move. The winner is determined according to the traditional rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

To make your move, click on the corresponding button on the GUI. The computer's move will be displayed in the window, along with the winner of the round. Your score will be displayed in the middle of the window.

You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button. This will set the score back to zero.
